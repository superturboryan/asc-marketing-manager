# /asc-marketing-manager

Start ASC Marketing Manager for App Store Connect text metadata or screenshot assets.

## Arguments

- `env`: path to the App Store Connect env file (optional)
- `desired`: path to desired-state JSON (optional)
- `version`: App Store version string (optional)
- `sheet`: Google Sheet ID or sheet context (optional)
- `assets`: local screenshot asset folder (optional)
- `mode`: `setup`, `dry-run`, or `apply` (optional; default: infer from request)

## Workflow

1. Use the `asc-marketing-manager` skill.
2. Read the skill's `SKILL.md` before making App Store Connect changes.
3. If using Google Sheets, read `references/google-sheet-localizations.md` and use the Google Sheets connector to build transient desired-state JSON in `/private/tmp`.
4. If uploading screenshots, read `references/asset-folder-screenshots.md` and run `asc-sync-assets.mjs`.
5. Always run the matching bundled script with `--dry-run` first.
6. Do not run `--apply` unless the user explicitly asks after reviewing a clean dry run.
7. Keep credentials, unreleased desired metadata, and unreleased asset folders out of commits unless the user explicitly wants them tracked.

## Guardrails

- Never print full `.env` files, `.p8` contents, JWTs, review passwords, or other credentials.
- Screenshot apply mode replaces targeted screenshot sets; summarize that clearly before apply.
- Treat app preview, build selection, review attachment, submission, phased-release creation, routing coverage, and rating reset as future scope.
